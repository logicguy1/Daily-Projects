## Next in the Alphabet | Day 7

Create a function which returns the next letters alphabetically in a given string. If the last letter is a "Z", change the rest of the letters accordingly.

# Examples
```py
next_letters("A") ➞ "B"

next_letters("ABC") ➞ "BCD"

next_letters("Z") ➞ "AA"

next_letters("CAZ") ➞ "CBA"

next_letters("") ➞ "A"```
